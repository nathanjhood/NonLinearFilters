![FirstOrderNonLinearFilter-MainImage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathanjhood/NonLinearFilters/main/FirstOrderNonLinearFilter/Res/FirstOrderNonLinearFilter-MainImage.png)

+ Initial implementation of non-linear 1st- and 2nd- order filters are up and ready to go...
+ More coming soon!

...stay tuned for more!

I will try to take some breaks inbetween GUI work and other errands in order to provide some interesting write-ups on the core module at play here - and the many myriad use cases that module has ahead :) - but life is generally busy and I only do this in my spare time, so please stay tuned :)
